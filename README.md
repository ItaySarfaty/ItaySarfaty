My name is Itay,

As a UI/UX developer, I have a keen passion for designing intuitive applications utilizing a human-centric approach. 

I know the importance of developer experience. Modular, easy-to-understand code is essential for project success. Keeping this in mind, I strive to write well-structured and efficient code to promote collaboration and enable scalability.
